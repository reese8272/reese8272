# Reese P Ludwick

Hi, I'm @reese8272, a 22-year-old aspiring programmer from the Eastern Panhandle of WV. Iâ€™m interested in sports (especially bowling and pole vault), Rubik's cubes, and constantly developing my learning habits.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python, C, Git, SQL
- **Technologies**: Azure, Git, GitHub, Tensorflow

## Projects
1. **[Password Management](https://github.com/reese8272/Password-Manager)**: This project uses the Fernet Symmetric Encryption Algorithm to encrypt locally stored passwords and store them in a local database (also encrypted). Given a Master Password, a user can access their passwords in plaintext. Without a Master Password, the user will not be able to see the encrypted passwords
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, CyberSecurity Module, SQL
   - **Key Learnings**: Implementing fundamental knowledge of standard encryption methods, and how to implement those to a SQLite database, and lastly marrying those two through python.

2. **[Machine Learning Via MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/reese8272/mnist-cnn-project)**: This project uses the built in MNIST dataset from tensorflow to build a convolutional neural network. The neural network is built from scratch and trained on the dataset, and it implements a callback method for when the training reaches 99.5% training accuracy and a 95% testing accuracy.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, VS Code, TensorFlow
   - **Key Learnings**: Implementing fundamental Machine Learning theory, working with the TensorFlow library, understanding key concepts of basic neural networks.

## Fun Fact
I can solve a Rubik's cube in about 11 seconds!
